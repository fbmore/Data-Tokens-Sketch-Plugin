# Data Tokens
Apply Data Tokens from:
- A public GSheet URL (.tsv)
- An endpoint that returns a .tsv file
- Paste TSV (Tab Separated Values) from Gsheet, Numbers or Excel

The plugin also allows to quickly generate:
- TSV data (a spreadsheet) with the list of Data Token Names and corresponding values using in the designs by running the command: ”Export Data Tokens to TSV (from Selected Artboards or Page)”
- Data Tokens Reference Sheet (It creates a new page and artboard containing all Data Tokens and all their options)
